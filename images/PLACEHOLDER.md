## Note
To quickly get the website working with placeholder images, you can use online services like:
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) - Free high-quality stock photos
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) - Free stock photos
- [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) - Placeholder images

Example with Lorem Picsum:
1. Replace references to `hero-bg.jpg` with `https://picsum.photos/1920/1080`

You can also modify the HTML files to reference your own images with different filenames.
